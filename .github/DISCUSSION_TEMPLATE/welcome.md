Thanks for joining the conversation! This space is for collaborative learning around the NFL_Game_Picker project. Please keep the mission in mind: this is a learning platform — not a betting system.

Suggested categories and what to post

- Q&A: Ask how to run the pipeline, interpret metrics, or resolve errors.
- Ideas: Propose features (e.g., coaching continuity), validation approaches, or visualizations.
- Research: Share experiments, calibration studies, error cohort analyses, and backtest learnings.
- Show & Tell: Share your runs, dashboards, or tooling that integrates with the project.
- Docs/Clarifications: Suggest wording improvements and gaps in documentation.

Posting tips

- Include gates (train/test/predict) and your `--tag` if referring to a run.
- State what changed and why; include metrics (accuracy + log-loss) and artifacts.
- Respect the no‑gambling ethos; do not post betting strategies or picks for wagering.

Code of conduct (short)

- Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive. Focus on code and ideas.
- No spam or promotion of gambling services.
- Violations may be removed.

Maintainers: Pin this welcome note so newcomers see it first.
