## Welcome to Discussions

This is the home for questions, ideas, research notes, and show‑and‑tell related to NFL_Game_Picker. Keep the project’s mission in mind: learning and rigorous methodology — not betting.

Suggested categories

- Q&A: “How do I choose gates for backtesting?” “Why is my weekly accuracy so volatile?”
- Ideas: “Add coaching continuity features” “Alternative triage heuristics” “New visualizations”
- Research: “Platt scaling vs. isotonic on our data” “Error cohorts by spread range” “Override gating thresholds”
- Show & Tell: “My week‑8 run with SHAP plots” “Workflow automation scripts” “Dashboards”
- Docs/Clarifications: “This section was confusing” “Add a pointer to TROUBLESHOOTING.md here”

Good post includes

- Context: What you’re trying to do and why.
- Gates + Tag: `--traingate`, `--testgate`, `--predictgate`, and your `--tag`.
- What changed: One change at a time.
- Metrics: Accuracy + log‑loss (and baseline comparison if relevant).
- Artifacts: paths to `logs/` and `data/models/` where helpful.
